# Hangman Pair Programming Assignment

This project is a simple console application which mimics the classic game Hangman.  

The user inputs one letter at a time and the program compares it to a character array. If the input matches any letters in the hidden word, those letters are unhidden.  If no matches are found, a body part is added to the gallows.  The game continues until a full body hangs from the gallows or the user completes the hidden word.

This was done as a paired programming assignment with a classmate during my time at Eleven Fifty Academy.
